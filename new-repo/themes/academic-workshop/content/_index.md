# Design

Welcome to the [Academic Workshop](https://github.com/aterenin/academic-workshop) Zola theme!
This theme is designed for hosting a scientific workshop or seminar series website.

## Features

* A customizable header, with support for a banner, icon, title text, subtitle, date, and link, all enabled via straightforward options in the config file.
* Shortcodes implementing various useful features:
    * Split the page into sections with a different background color.
    * Create a two-dimensional image grid, for instance for displaying a list of speakers, with support for 2x3, 2x4, and other layouts, as well as automatic image resizing for both 1x and retina 2x displays.
    * Create a list of previous seminars, complete with appropriate buttons and links.
    * Import and autogenerate tables from external data, including with buttons for links such as paper download URLs.
    * Create buttons pointing to other pages.
* Easily-customizable colors by overriding `main.scss`, including dark mode via CSS variables.
* Simple, straightforward, easy-to-use, and easy-to-extend programmatic interface.
* No JavaScript or CSS dependencies of any kind, built in a way that is [designed to last](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/), even as web and browser standards change.
